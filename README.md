## Problem Statement

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company), a prominent computer hardware producer based in India with a strong international presence, has identified a need for enhanced data insights to facilitate swift and informed decision-making within the organization.

Recognizing the importance of bolstering their data analytics capabilities, the management has proposed an expansion of their data analytics team. In alignment with this initiative, Tony Sharma, the Director of Data Analytics at Atliq Hardwares, is seeking to recruit multiple junior data analysts. Mr. Sharma is particularly interested in individuals who possess a combination of technical proficiency and strong soft skills.

To assess and identify suitable candidates, Mr. Sharma has devised a SQL challenge that aims to evaluate both technical and interpersonal competencies, ensuring the selected individuals contribute effectively to the company's data-driven decision-making processes.
